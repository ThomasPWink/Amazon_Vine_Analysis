# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine if there is any bias for Amazon Vine members to provide positive reviews over non-Vine members.  In this analysis the data set used was under the sports category.  During the review we will look at only data sets that were found to be helpful as well as Vine and Non-Vine member reviews that had over 20 total votes.

  ## Summary
  After reviewing the data, I have not found any bias for positive reviews based on Vine membership or not.  In this data set non-Vine members were more likely to provide a 5-star rating compared to Vine members by over 10%.  Vine members left 41% 5-star reviews compared to non-Vine members leaving 5-star reviews 53% of the time.  Vine reviews in the data set were relatively small at only 334 of the total 62,000 reviews.  For further review additional analysis could be done to include verified purchases as well.  This will help to ensure that reviews are from actual purchase and there for legitimate reviews.
